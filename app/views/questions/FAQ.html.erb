<h3>How much does juvenile expungement cost?</h3>
<p>It costs $124 to expunge a single arrest, plus an extra $64 for each additional arrest - this includes filing fees (to the court) and the expungement fee (to the IL state police). However, many people qualify for a fee waiver that makes expungement free.</p>

<h3>How long does the process take?</h3>
<p>Usually, a court date is scheduled about 1.5 months from the petition date. After a judge approves the petition on the court date, it takes about 2 months for the police to erase records. So, 3.5 months total. If necessary, expungement can be expedited to about 2.5 months total.</p>

<h3>After I petition for juvenile expungement, what are the chances that my petition will be approved?</h3>
