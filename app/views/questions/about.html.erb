<p>This is a web app created for people with juvenile records.</p>

<p>A juvenile record makes it difficult to get a job. The good news is that juvenile records don't have to be permanent, as they can be expunged. However, although many people qualify for expungement, <a href="http://chiyouthjustice.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/cook-county-juvenile-expungement-numbers-vs-arrests/">few actually submit a petition</a>. This app aims to be an easy-to-share landing page to de-mystify expungement, with the hope of getting more folks to kick off the expungement process!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mikvachallenge.org/site/epage/146561_719.htm">idea for this app</a> came from the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/MCJJustice">Juvenile Justice Council</a> of the <a href="https://twitter.com/MikvaChallenge">Mikva Challenge</a></p>
